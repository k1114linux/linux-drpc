# Terminal-Based DiscordRPC Program
This program is designed to allow you to create your own DiscordRPC easily and quickly directly from the terminal in Linux, in an optimized way.

## Installation
To install this program, you will need the `discord-rpc` library, which is also included in this repository. You might need to spend a little time compiling it.

> You can easily install this program using `xbps-src` and my template, which is available in the repository under the same name. The link will appear later after the project is fully completed.
